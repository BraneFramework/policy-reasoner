description = """
A minimal policy reasoner implementation that can be used as a base for new policy reasoners.

This no-operation reasoner is meant to be an example, and can be used as a base to build new reasoners on top of.
Furthermore it can be used for testing. The reasoner approves all workflow validation requests by default (it does
not perform any permission checks, and thus never rejects a request).
